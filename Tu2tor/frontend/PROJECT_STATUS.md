## 🎯 Smart Matching Demo Script

### Setup
- Mock data includes 7 tutors with different availability
- User can select 2-3 time preferences
- Algorithm calculates match scores

### Demo Flow (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Basic Matching (Fixed Weights)**
1. Navigate to Search page
2. Select subject: "Python Programming"
3. Select time preferences:
   - Wednesday 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM
   - Friday 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM
4. View results with recommendation chips:
   - John Doe: 98 points [⏰ Time Match] [⭐ High Rating]
   - Sarah Lim: 85 points [⏰ Time Match] [🚀 Fast Response]

**Step 2: Dynamic Weighting**
1. Enable "Dynamic Weighting" toggle
2. Drag slider to right (Prioritize Rating)
   - Weights adjust: Time 0% → Rating 60% → Response 40%
   - List re-ranks: Higher rated tutors move to top
3. Drag slider to left (Prioritize Time)
   - Weights adjust: Time 60% → Rating 30% → Response 10%
   - Tutors with better time match move to top
4. Disable toggle → returns to fixed weights

**Step 3: Feedback Learning**
1. Click "Time Mismatch" on a tutor
   - Tutor ranking lowered by 20 points
   - Hidden from subsequent searches
2. Click "Not Relevant" on another tutor
   - Tutor completely hidden
3. (Part 3 feature) System automatically adjusts preference after 3+ feedbacks
